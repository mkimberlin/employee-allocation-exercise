# Simple Test First Exercise
This is a simple project to demonstrate the general flow of test first development using [JUnit](http://junit.org) and
[Mockito](http://mockito.org).  It's quick and dirty, but you can certainly get the point by following the evolution of
the project [commit-by-commit](https://github.com/mkimberlin/employee-allocation-exercise/commits/master).
